# Saving Tool

This is a simple crud electron-react app that uses local storage to keep a list of things that I want to purchase, and can keep track of my savings goals

## Running yourself
This was made for macos and to run and build do the following

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run dist`

The dmg file will be generated inside of the directory and dist. You can then run it on your mac.
